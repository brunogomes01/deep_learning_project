# Deep Learning Project  
## Neural Network Modeling for Pattern Recognition

---

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on applying **Deep Learning** techniques using **Neural Networks** to learn complex patterns from data.

The objective is to design, train, and evaluate a deep learning model capable of extracting non-linear relationships and producing meaningful predictions or classifications, depending on the problem context.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional machine learning models may struggle with highly complex or high-dimensional data.

Deep Learning addresses this challenge by:
- Automatically learning hierarchical feature representations
- Modeling complex non-linear relationships
- Scaling effectively with larger datasets

This project demonstrates these concepts through practical experimentation.
